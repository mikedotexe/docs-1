## Overview

The NEAR platform exposes a JSON-RPC interface which is the primary API for interacting with the blockchain.

For convenience, NEAR also provides two language bindings:
- JavaScript SDK (called `nearlib`)
- and a Rust SDK (called `near-bindgen`)

We welcome members of our community to add other language bindings and will be happy to provide support along the way.  Just let us know with a note to hello@nearprotocol.com

## Getting Started

The best source of examples across the platform is currently the tests.  Some parts of the system are also documented with introductions and examples.  Everything is open source.
